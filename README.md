# Organoborazine ML Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the maximum absorption wavelength (λ_max) of organoborazines based on their structural and chemical properties. We employ a Random Forest Regressor model, optimized through hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Overview

Organoborazines are an important class of compounds with potential applications in optoelectronic devices. This project aims to accelerate the discovery and design of new organoborazines by predicting their λ_max values using machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Random Forest Regression model
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Model evaluation using various metrics (MSE, MAE, R2, RMSE, Bias, Correlation Coefficient)
